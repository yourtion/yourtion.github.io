刚刚换过IP的我居然在第二天再次被墙~依旧是在那个IP卡住~看了最近墙变高了~~

发邮件过去想他再帮我换一次~结果回复如下：

> Hello,

> As stated before Backy LLC does not change servers for free clients. We  provide the server that you are on if you wish to be relocated you will  be required to purchase a paid hosting upgrade. You have paid nothing  for the service not even with ads. As a result I am sorry however there  is nothing wrong with the server its an issue on your end with your ISP  and as a result you will have to move to a paid hosting package to get  the account migrated to a different server.

> Sincerely,

> William Backy

> CEO/Owner Backy LLC

这样就只能换服务器，找了很久结果决定用freehostia的服务器·但是上传发现它居然不能访问外网，没办法·只能再换别的··找到一个x10Hosting的居然要限制IP，结果只能挂代理上去··申请~解析··现在就正常了···

希望不要再次杯具···
